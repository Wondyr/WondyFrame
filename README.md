### WondyFrame is a [Discord.js](http://discord.js.org) bot for finding information about items or current world state.

## General Information
I made WondyFrame for personal use and a learning experience, but I thought I should share it for others to use as well. Few things you can expect about the bot:
 1. Getting the current information on stuff like Sortie, Invasions, Fissures and more.
 2. Being able to search for items, prime items will also have the best drop locations for the each relic with that prime item in it. This is a WIP command, but works pretty well  so far.
 3. See when/where Baro Ki'Teer arrives and the full inventory he brings.
 
## Private Docker Build
This bot is hosted privately and there is no way to host it yourself. Instead invite the bot to your own server. WondyBot is online 24/7 with alert detector if the bot goes down.
